Stemming and Lemmatization are itself form of NLP and widely used in Text mining. Text Mining is the process of analysis of texts written in natural language and extract high-quality information from text. It involves looking for interesting patterns in the text or to extract data from the text to be inserted into a database. Text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities). Developers have to prepare text using lexical analysis, POS (Parts-of-speech) tagging, stemming and other Natural Language Processing techniques to gain useful information from text.

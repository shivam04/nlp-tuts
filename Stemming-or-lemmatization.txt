Stemming or lemmatization?
After going through the entire tutorial, you may be asking yourself when should I use Stemming and when should I use Lemmatization? The answer itself is in whatever you have learned from this tutorial. You have seen the following points:

Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of the inflected words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas, lemma is an actual language word.

Stemming follows an algorithm with steps to perform on the words which makes it faster. Whereas, in lemmatization, you used WordNet corpus and a corpus for stop words as well to produce lemma which makes it slower than stemming. You also had to define a parts-of-speech to obtain the correct lemma.

So when to use what! The above points show that if speed is focused then stemming should be used since lemmatizers scan a corpus which consumed time and processing. It depends on the application you are working on that decides if stemmers should be used or lemmatizers. If you are building a language application in which language is important you should use lemmatization as it uses a corpus to match root forms.

That's the end of the tutorial! In this tutorial, you learned about NLP, Python NLTK package, how to use the package and how to use the lexical resources in Python. You learned about Stemming, Lemmatization, their applications and how you can use them in Python NLP applications. Happy Learning!

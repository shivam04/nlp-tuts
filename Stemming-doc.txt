Stemming a document
You can write your own function that can stem documents. Here is one way to stem a document using Python filing:

1. Take a document as the input.
2. Read the document line by line
3. Tokenize the line
4. Stem the words
5. Output the stemmed words (print on screen or write to a file)
6. Repeat step 2 to step 5 until it is to the end of the document.

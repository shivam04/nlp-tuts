Lemmatization, unlike Stemming, reduces the inflected words properly ensuring that the root word belongs to the language. In Lemmatization root word is called Lemma. A lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata) is the canonical form, dictionary form, or citation form of a set of words.


For example, runs, running, ran are all forms of the word run, therefore run is the lemma of all these words. Because lemmatization returns an actual word of the language, it is used where it is necessary to get valid words.
